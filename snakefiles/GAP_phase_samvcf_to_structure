"""
This is a snakefile that takes as input a .sam.gz file, a vcf.gz file, a reference genome in fasta format, and a par file to produce a phased genome map.

Workflow Overview:
1. The input sam.gz files may be very large, so we first split them into smaller files,
   each containing 10 million unique read IDs (which means ~20 million SAM entries for paired-end reads).
2. This splitting is done using a Snakemake checkpoint because we don't know ahead of time
   how many parts will be created (depends on the file size).
3. After splitting, we parallelize the processing of these smaller files through sam2seg.

Checkpoint Workflow:
- The 'split_samgz_by_readid' checkpoint splits the sam.gz file and creates a part_count.txt file
- The 'get_all_split_outputs' function reads the part_count.txt to determine how many parts were created
- Downstream rules can then process each part in parallel using the {part} wildcard
