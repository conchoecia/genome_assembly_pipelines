# Genome Assembly Pipelines

This is a collection of `snakemake` pipelines that are designed to aid in the _de novo_ assembly of genomes.

**Movitvation:** As much as we would like genome assembly to be a one-command operation, 
it involves many steps, parameters to optimize, and comparisons between assembly versions. 
These tasks become more complicated when working with highly heterozygous species.
